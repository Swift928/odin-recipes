    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is a picture of a very simple and traditional cheese burger. The cheese burger is famous and has been
        around for nearly a century. It was created by accident by Lionel Sternberger in the 1920's and has been with us
        ever since.
    </p>
    <p>I'm going to show you how to create the iconic cheese burger with just a few ingredients. 
        To make a simple cheeseburger, start by shaping ground beef into patties and seasoning with salt and pepper. 
        Cook the patties on a preheated grill or stove-top pan over medium-high heat until they reach your desired doneness.
         During the last minute of cooking, top each patty with a slice of cheese and cover to melt. 
         Toast the burger buns, assemble the burgers with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and condiments of your choice, and enjoy.
